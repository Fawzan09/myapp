# 🚀 VS Code Quick Start for Phi-1 Android App

## ✅ Yes, you can run this Android app in VS Code!

The project is now configured with VS Code tasks and settings. Here's how to get started:

## 📦 Required Extensions

VS Code will prompt you to install these when you open the project:

1. **Java Extension Pack** - Essential for Java/Kotlin development
2. **Kotlin Language** - Kotlin syntax highlighting and support
3. **Gradle for Java** - Build system integration
4. **Android Dev Extension** - Android development tools

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. Install Android SDK
```bash
# Option A: Install Android Studio (recommended)
# Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
# This automatically sets up the Android SDK

# Option B: Command line tools only
# Download SDK tools and set environment variables:
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android-sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### 2. Open Project in VS Code
```bash
# Method A: From VS Code
# File → Open Folder → Select /workspaces/myapp

# Method B: From terminal
code /workspaces/myapp
```

### 3. Install Recommended Extensions
- VS Code will show a notification about recommended extensions
- Click "Install All" or install individually

## 🚀 Running the App in VS Code

### Method 1: Using VS Code Tasks (Recommended)

1. **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. **Type**: "Tasks: Run Task"
3. **Select**: "Install Debug APK"

This will:
- ✅ Build the debug APK
- ✅ Install it on your connected device
- ✅ Show progress in VS Code terminal

### Method 2: Using Integrated Terminal

```bash
# Open terminal in VS Code: Ctrl+` (backtick)

# Build and install
./gradlew installDebug

# Or use the interactive script
./build.sh
```

### Method 3: Using Build Tasks

- **Press**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- **Type**: "Tasks: Run Build Task"
- **Select**: "Build Debug APK"

## 📱 Available VS Code Tasks

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → Select:

- 🔨 **Build Debug APK** - Compile the app
- 📱 **Install Debug APK** - Build and install on device
- 🏗️ **Build Release APK** - Production build
- 🧹 **Clean Project** - Remove build files
- 🔍 **Lint Check** - Code quality analysis
- 📄 **View Device Logs** - Monitor app logs

## 🔧 VS Code Features for Android Development

### Code Editing
- ✅ **Kotlin syntax highlighting**
- ✅ **Error detection** and warnings
- ✅ **Code completion** (basic)
- ✅ **File navigation** and search
- ✅ **Git integration** built-in

### Building & Running
- ✅ **Gradle integration** via tasks
- ✅ **Terminal access** for ADB commands
- ✅ **Build output** in integrated terminal
- ✅ **Error parsing** from build logs

### Project Management
- ✅ **File explorer** for project navigation
- ✅ **Search and replace** across files
- ✅ **Extensions** for enhanced functionality
- ✅ **Version control** with Git

## 📱 Device Setup

### Physical Device
```bash
# 1. Enable Developer Options:
#    Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times
#
# 2. Enable USB Debugging:
#    Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging
#
# 3. Connect via USB and allow debugging
```

### Check Device Connection
```bash
# In VS Code terminal:
adb devices
# Should show your device listed
```

## 🎯 Quick Development Workflow

1. **Edit Code**: Use VS Code's editor with Kotlin support
2. **Build**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Build Debug APK"
3. **Install**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Install Debug APK"
4. **Debug**: Use "View Device Logs" task to see app output
5. **Iterate**: Make changes and repeat

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Java not found"
```bash
# Install Java Extension Pack
# Or set Java path in VS Code settings
```

### "Gradle sync failed"
```bash
# Open terminal and run:
./gradlew --version
# If gradle wrapper is missing, copy from Android Studio project
```

### "Device not detected"
```bash
# Check USB debugging is enabled
# Run: adb devices
# Try: adb kill-server && adb start-server
```

### "Build fails"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild:
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## 💡 VS Code vs Android Studio

### VS Code Advantages
- ✅ **Lightweight** and fast startup
- ✅ **Excellent Git integration**
- ✅ **Great terminal integration**
- ✅ **Flexible workspace** management
- ✅ **Rich extension ecosystem**

### VS Code Limitations
- ❌ **No visual layout editor**
- ❌ **No device emulator** (need external)
- ❌ **Basic code completion** for Android APIs
- ❌ **No built-in profiling** tools

### Recommendation
- **Use VS Code for**: Code editing, Git, terminal work, lightweight development
- **Use Android Studio for**: Layout design, debugging, profiling, complex Android features
