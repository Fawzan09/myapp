## 🚀 What Each Task Does

### 📱 Install Debug APK
- Builds the debug version of your Phi-1 app
- Installs it on connected Android device
- **Use this** for testing your app

### 🔨 Build Debug APK  
- Only builds the APK file
- Creates `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Use this** if you want to manually install later

### 🎯 Demo App Features
- Shows a simulation of what your app does
- Demonstrates the UI flow and features
- **Use this** to understand the app without building

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ⚠️ Build Fails with "Plugin not found"?
This happens when Android SDK is not installed. **This is normal in demo environments!**

```bash
# You have 3 options:

# Option 1: Run in demo mode (recommended for now)
./build.sh  # Choose option 1, it will show simulated build

# Option 2: Install Android SDK for real development
# Download Android Studio from: https://developer.android.com/studio

# Option 3: See what the app does without building
./demo.sh  # Shows app features and UI flow
```

### ⚠️ ANDROID_HOME Warning?
```bash
# This is expected without Android Studio installed
# The app is still complete and ready - just needs development environment

# To set up for real development:
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android-sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### Tasks Not Showing?
```bash
# Check if .vscode/tasks.json exists
ls -la .vscode/

# Reload VS Code window
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
```

### Task Fails?
```bash
# Check permissions
chmod +x ./build.sh
chmod +x ./demo.sh

# Run manually to test
./build.sh
```
